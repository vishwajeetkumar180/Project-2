TIME SERIES FORECASTING USING ADAPTIVE ARIMA AND LSTM MODEL

This project is based on forecasting of stock prices ,whether forecasting etc ..Initial we learn the basic models for forecasting after that we use ARIMA model ,
then we found that the mean squared error is large then we apply wavelets on it to minimize the error after that we apply adaptive wavelet ARIMA .
